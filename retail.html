<p>Peter has earned his diploma and things are looking up, he's attained a job working retail were upper managment is a possibility. There's no time to work on creative endeavors but heck the pays almost worth it. Maybe Peter will even attempt school again in order to earn a Master's and a lifetime of untenured teaching positions! </p>
